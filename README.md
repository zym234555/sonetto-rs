- Currency logic (soon)
- Profile picture (soon)
- Real battle logic (right now we skip battle to the end)
- Auto battle (soon)
- Drop rates need to be tested

## KnownBugs
- 7 day sign is bugged (sometimes rewards are given twice 12 am and 12:30 am) (I blame the game for using 3 different time formats)(u64, i64 and i32 lmao)
- Ezio has max number of moxie its a visual bug (no idea why yet) (normal max is 5 he's showing almost a 100)

## Plans for the future

For now I'll just fix the handles that are not working. Then implement a proper system for users to manage their accounts and progress.
Right now everything is hardcoded to be maxed out which isn't ideal for some people. Eventually we'll add proper currency logic and real battle logic.

## Todo
- remove unnecessary code
- remove unused static/starter data
